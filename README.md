# odin-etch-a-sketch
In this project, I will be creating another project from Odin Project, Etch-a-Sketch. 

Live version: https://alphasnoopy.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/

### Once completed, I will have demonstrated my ability to:
* Use Pseudo-Elements (::before, ::after) and CSS Variables
* Implement Grid display with attributes in each div
* Create a Input/Slider with corresponding Label
* Feature Animation and Keyframes
  - Mimic a 'shaking' animation used to clear an Etch-a-Sketch using margins and flex-start/end

Side Note: 
* Rock Paper Scissors has been changed to Rock Paper Scissors Spock in reference to a 
game in Big Bang Theory that was initially created by Sam Kass
